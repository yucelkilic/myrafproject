Calibration, is a step that must be done to  any raw data taken via a CCD camera.
Calibration must be done using 3 types of files:

1- Bias (zero), Taken By observer.
2- Dark, Taken By observer.
3- Flat, Taken By observer.

and basic mathematical expression of calibration is:

                             (DATA - Bias) - (Dark - Bias)
Calibrated_data = --------------------------------------
                               (Flat - Bias) - (Dark - Bias)


However before proceed you need to know an observer will obtain multiple Biases, Darks and Flats (Calibration files) and to obtain more accurate calibration file analyser must do zero, dark and flat combines.
IRAF serves multiple choises for combining and the basic ones are: zerocombine, darkcombine and flatcombines. As the names suggest we'll use zerocombine (same for dark and flat) to combine bias(zero) files and create a master_zero file to be used in calibration process.

IRAF offers zerocombine, darkcombine and flatcombine as shown:

MyRAF simplifies all of these settings as shown:

Please keep in mind some times due to a variety of reasons some of calibration data (Biases, darks or flats) might have high uncertainties. We need to exclude these kind of files. For this we can use IRAF's imstat task. Imstat returns some informations about the fits file and one of them is 'Standard Deviation' of the file. the lower Standard Deviation, the better is the file.
For that MyRAF offers 'Get Stat':

Some times an analyser would want to do calibration to larg count of files and these files might be in defferent paths in file system. MyRaf can detect dublicate data in lits, based on only file name and not the whole path, and remove them from list:
